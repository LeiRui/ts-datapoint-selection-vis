## How is the repository structured?

- The codebase is located in the `agg_utils` folder.
- Additional details can be found in the respective README.md files in the `details` folder.
- Supplementary gifs can be found in the `gifs` folder.
- See [notebooks README](notebooks/) for the more details.
  - The `0.*` notebooks contain data parsing and figure generation.
  - The `1.*` notebooks performing the core experiments (visual representativeness and visual stability).
  - The `varia_*` notebooks perform further analysis: OR-conv, toolkit comparison, and M4 pixel-perfect nuances.
